# Space Mission Data Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of space mission data from 1957 to 2023. The data includes information about space missions such as launch failures, rocket usage, launch times, and launch locations.

## Analysis Procedure

The analysis was conducted using Python programming language with the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** The space mission data was loaded from a CSV file using the Pandas library in Python.

2. **Launch Failure Analysis:** The data was filtered to identify missions with launch failures. The number of launch failures over the years was calculated and visualized using a line plot.

3. **Most Used Rockets:** The frequency of each rocket's usage was calculated, and the top 10 most used rockets were identified and visualized using a bar plot.

4. **Launch Time Analysis:** The launch times were extracted from the data, and the distribution of launches by hour was calculated and visualized using a bar plot.

5. **Rockets with Most Failures:** The rockets with the most failures were identified, and the top 10 rockets with the most failures were visualized using a bar plot.

6. **Most Used Launch Locations:** The launch locations were analyzed to identify the most used locations, and the top 5 most used launch locations were visualized using a bar plot.

## Final Report

The final report of the space mission data analysis is as follows:
